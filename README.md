# MillieJS

MillieJS is a Node.js library written in TypeScript that provides an incremental
store inspired by Apple's iOS NSIncrementalStore. The name "MillieJS" is a play
on the word "millimeter," reflecting the incremental nature of the library.
MillieJS is designed to be flexible and can be extended to work with a variety of
sources of truth and replica stores. Whether you're working on a new
application or looking to add incremental storage capabilities to an existing
one, MillieJS is an excellent choice for a fast, reliable, and scalable
solution.

## Disclaimer

The MillieJS library is currently in its early development stages and is not
ready for use in production applications. There may be bugs and performance
issues that have not yet been addressed. Use the library at your own risk and
be sure to thoroughly test any implementation before deploying it to a live
environment.

Please note that the API and functionality may change as the library continues
to evolve. If you choose to use MillieJS in your project, we recommend regularly
checking for updates and making any necessary modifications to your code to
ensure compatibility.

**In summary, do not use the MillieJS library in a production environment until
further notice.**
