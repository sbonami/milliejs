# MillieJS

MillieJS is a Node.js library written in TypeScript that provides an incremental
store inspired by Apple's iOS NSIncrementalStore.  MillieJS is designed to be
flexible and can be extended to work with a variety of interfaces. Whether
you're working on a new application or looking to add incremental storage
capabilities, MillieJS is an excellent choice for a fast, reliable, and
scalable solution.

The name "MillieJS" is a play on the word "millimeter," reflecting the
incremental nature of the library.

## Disclaimer

The MillieJS library is currently in its early development stages and is not
ready for use in production applications. There may be bugs and performance
issues that have not yet been addressed. Use the library at your own risk and
be sure to thoroughly test any implementation before deploying it to a live
environment.

Please note that the API and functionality may change as the library evolves
and stabilizes. If you choose to use MillieJS in your project, we recommend
regularly checking for updates and making any necessary modifications to your
code to ensure compatibility.

**In summary, do not use the MillieJS library in a production environment until
further notice.**
