        ## Have Patience
        MillieJS is a pre-production library with a small but growing community. At this stage, a bug may be due to missing or incomplete functionality, sparse documentation, or a happy little accident. Bear with us, or better yet help us out with a pull request.

        ## Troubleshoot
        If MillieJS is not behaving the way you expect, we'd ask you to look at the [documentation](/docs) and search the issue tracker for evidence supporting your expectation. Please make reasonable efforts to troubleshoot and rule out issues with your code, the configuration, or any 3rd party libraries you might be using.

        ## Make a minimal reproduction
        To ease the report filing process, please create a GitHub repository with a minimal (but complete) example and simple/clear steps on how to reproduce the bug. If all your tests fail with a strange error, can you find a way to show us with just one? If you have many configuration options, can you simplify it?

        The simpler you can make it, the more likely we are to successfully verify and fix the bug.
